# Hi, I’m Aaron 👋

I build products from MVP to scale.

My real coding life isn’t just launching features. It’s debugging production issues that only appear under real traffic. It’s refactoring early logic when growth exposes weak architecture. It’s reviewing logs, fixing migrations carefully, and cleaning up commits before merging.

I’ve learned that scaling doesn’t happen because of one big decision - it happens because of small, disciplined technical choices made from day one.

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

* Turn early ideas into structured, scalable systems
* Design multi-tenant architectures that won’t collapse later
* Build full-stack applications with real-world constraints
* Integrate AI into production workflows — not just demos
* Optimize systems when real users and real data hit


## ⚙️ Core Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
* **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, FastAPI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, Supabase, MongoDB
* **AI & Data:** OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain
* **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Vercel, Docker, GitHub Actions


## 🧠 How I Work

I follow a product-first approach.

That means:

* Architecture decisions align with business goals
* MVPs are built for iteration, not rewrites
* Clean Git history and structured commits matter
* Systems are designed for real users, real traffic, real growth

Shipping fast matters.
But building something that survives growth matters more.
