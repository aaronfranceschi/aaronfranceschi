# Hi, I’m Aaron - an AI-Driven Full-Stack Engineer building scalable systems.

I build products from MVP to scale.

My real coding life isn't just launching features. It's debugging production issues that only appear under real traffic. It's refactoring early logic when growth exposes weak architecture. It's reviewing logs, fixing migrations carefully, and cleaning up commits before merging.

I've learned that scaling doesn’t happen because of one big decision - it happens because of small, disciplined technical choices made from day one.
